- Database with 8 tables
- Each table should have at least 5 records (rows), including two
- Tables with at least 50 records and several meaningful constraints
- Used primary and foreign key for IDs to not repeat the same date in order to save space, speed up operation and make the database easier to use
- Created 3 views, 3 triggers, 3 procedures, 1 function, and 5 SQL queries that demonstrate the capabilities of the database
- Used MSQL
